This repository provides solutions to most of the programming questions in the exercise (at the back) of chapters for Bao Ji's Book. Sharing these with you, so that they might help you in understanding the concepts. 

## Reference Book

*The questions are taken from the book [Assembly Language Programming by Bilal Hashmi and Junaid Haroon](https://onlinebookpoint.blogspot.com/2016/10/assembly-language-programming-delivered.html)*

Its an excellent book for understanding the language and concepts of 8086 Assembly. It starts from the very basics and then takes you to advanced concepts in an efficient manner. Highly Recommended!

## How to Run
1- Download this code and move the 'assembly_code' folder to C: directory.

2- Install DOSBOX from this link: [Download DOSBOX Emulator](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1)

3- After complete installation, go to DOSBOX installation directory and run "DOSBox 0.74 Options.bat". This will save you from the pain of searching the configuration file yourself and will open that file for you.
Copy these lines at the end of that file:
```
mount c: c:\assembly_code 
```  
```
c:
```
4- Now to run any question (say named 'chp4_03.asm'), run DOSBOX 0.74 and type
```
nasm chp4_03.asm -o chp4_03.com  
```

To run the code, type:

```
chp4_03.com
```

To examine step by step working of the code, type

```
afd chp4_03.com
```

- If you find any bug in the code, you can edit that file and [propose a change request](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/). 

- Since there's always more than one way to solve a problem so I would highly appreciate if you share your solution of the problem too. This way we will have more than one solutions to a given question. For the geeks not familiar with the Git environment, you can email me the solution files at haris.muneer5@gmail.com

- Also, when I was studying Assembly I didn't get enough time to solve all questions of Chp 9 and 10. That's why you can find solutions to only some of the questions from these chapters. Therefore, I would encourage you to share your solutions of Chp 9 and 10 with me 
and I will add them to this repository. 

For any contribution that you make to this repository, I will give you credits for that and will mention your name in the respective file :)
